    """
    Simplify a graph by merging nearby nodes and consolidating segments.
    
    This function addresses the issue mentioned by Germain where a 100-meter
    street segment might be represented by 100 small segments. The simplification
    merges nodes that are closer than threshold_meters and consolidates the
    resulting segments.
    
    PENDING IMPLEMENTATION: Currently returns the graph unchanged.
    
    Algorithm (to be implemented):
        1. Build spatial index (KDTree) of all nodes
        2. For each node, find all nodes within threshold_meters
        3. Merge nearby nodes into super-nodes (e.g., at centroid)
        4. Reconnect segments to super-nodes
        5. Remove duplicate or zero-length segments
    
    Args:
        graph_data: GraphData object to simplify
        threshold_meters: Distance threshold for merging nodes (in meters)
    
    Returns:
        GraphData object with simplified graph
        (Currently returns input unchanged - PENDING IMPLEMENTATION)
    
    Example:
        >>> graph = acj.load_graph(nodes_df, segments_df)
        >>> simplified = acj.simplify_graph(graph, threshold_meters=10.0)
    
    Notes:
        - This is particularly useful for OSM data which can be over-segmented
        - Reduces the number of queries needed for point assignment
        - May slightly reduce spatial accuracy (by up to threshold_meters/2)
